With dark and white plumage and flipper-like wings, the birds are exceedingly adapted for life in the water. Most penguins survive on fish, krill, squid and other forms of sea life caught underwater. They spend about half of their existence on land and the other half in the water.  Even though all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are found beyond freezing climates. In fact, several species are found in temperate regions, such as the Galapagos Penguin that resides near the equator.  The largest living penguin species is the Emperor Penguin, and the smallest is the Little Blue Penguin. Larger penguins inhabit colder regions while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. Some prehistoric species reached enormous sizes, becoming as tall and heavy as an adult human. These were not limited to Antarctic regions.

With which of the following statements would the author likely disagree? The increased usage of mobile devices has resulted in some unintended and even dangerous consequences. Studies have shown that mobile communications are linked to a significant increase in distracted driving, resulting in injury and loss of life. In 2008, it was reported that driver distraction was the cause of 16 percent of all fatal crashes, leading to the deaths of 5,800 people; 21 percent of the crashes resulted in an injury, causing 515,000 people to be wounded. The studies also show that nearly 50 percent of teens admit to texting while driving. Distracted driving endangers life and property, and the current levels of injury and loss are unacceptable.  To stem this problem, safety organizations and other government agencies are working to inform and educate the public about the dangers of distracted driving and are seeking to identify and facilitate the development of innovative technologies that could reduce the incidence of distracted driving. Currently, there is no national ban on texting or using a wireless phone while driving, but a number of states have passed laws banning texting or wireless phones or requiring hands-free use of wireless phones while driving.','The number of teens who admit to texting while driving is likely higher than reported due to dishonest reporting.','Safety organizations would benefit from free publicity by informing the nation about the dangers of distracting driving.','Using a hands-free device is no less distracting than using a handheld phones and should be included in bans.','The use of mobile communications has had some positive consequences along with the negative.','Current levels of fatalities might be decreased if phone companies installed software that would alert parents to phone use while the phone is moving at speeds concurrent with vehicular movement.',4,'300','C','2017-08-22 21:35:33','2017-08-22 21:35:33'),(68,'A sheet of iron in the form of a sector of 60Â° and 18 inches radius is used to make a curved surface of a cone.
